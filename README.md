# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

* The repository shows an application where users can generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.  It has responsive user interface to be laid out properly on various size screens.

* The HTML code contains a logical structure for the elements within the page.  There are sections for the header, body and card footer.  The header contains the title "Password Generator' to describe the generator.  The body contain a field where the generated password will be displayed.  And the footer card footer contains a button called, "Generate Passord".  Selecting the button starts the process of generating a password.

* There is a linked Javascipt file, called: script.js.  This JavaScript file contains the code that allows for the generating of the unique password, based on user prompts. 

* Notes were applied to the HTML code and JavaScript code to identify each section of code. 

* When the passowor generator button is selected a series of alerts and prompts open to define what the password will contain.  The initial alert asks the user how many characters they would like the passowrd to contain.  After the alert are a series of prompts.  The first prompt asks the user to confirm if they want the password to include special characters.  The next prompt asks the user if they want the password to include numeric characters.  The next prompt asks the user if they want the password to include lowercase characters.  And the final prompt ask the user if they want the password to include Uppercase characters.  After all prompts are selected a password is generated based on criteria the user entered.
